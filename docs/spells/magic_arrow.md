## Notes

- Magic Arrow is considered a basic spell, despite having a magic symbol in each corner.
- Magic Arrow can benefit from spell power bonus to any school of magic, but it can only be affected by a single school of magic at a time.
- [^1] If a unit ignores a specific school of magic (it's immune to spells of that school of magic), it can *not* ignore the Magic Arrow.
